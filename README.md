# Generate-TV-Scripts
Project for [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), unit 4.

This project consists of generating its own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs and a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

## Steps:

1. Import Datasets
2. Data Exploration
3. Implement Preprocessing Functions (lookup table, tokenize punctuation)
4. Build the Neural Network (check access to gpu, input batching, test the Dataloader, modelling, defining forward and backpropagation)
5. Neural Network Training (train loop, hyperparameter tuning, training)
6. Generate TV Script (generate text, generate a new script)
